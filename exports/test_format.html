<h2>Introduction to Quantum Computing</h2>
<p>Quantum computing represents a revolutionary approach to computation that harnesses the principles of quantum mechanics. This section provides an overview of the fundamental concepts.</p>
<h3>Basic Quantum Principles</h3>
<p>Quantum computing relies on quantum bits (qubits) which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This property allows quantum computers to perform certain calculations exponentially faster than classical computers.</p>
<h3>Current Challenges</h3>
<p>Despite recent advances, quantum computers face several challenges including decoherence, error correction, and scalability issues. Researchers are actively working on solutions to these problems.</p>
<h2>Recent Developments</h2>
<p>The field of quantum computing has seen significant progress in recent years, with several breakthrough achievements in hardware and software development.</p>
<h3>Hardware Advances</h3>
<p>IBM and Google have achieved major milestones in quantum processor development, with IBM unveiling its 127-qubit Eagle processor and Google demonstrating quantum supremacy.</p>
